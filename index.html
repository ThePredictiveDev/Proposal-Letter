                    <h1>To my love</h1>
                    <p>Hi baby, even though I’m pretty sure we’re sitting right in front of each other as you read this letter (and yes, I will make you read it because there’s a little surprise at the end), I couldn’t help but try to put some of my feelings into words, no matter how impossible that feels. To be honest, this is probably the first love letter I’ve really put effort into, since I’ve always found writing a bit of a hassle (you know I’m lazy), but you’re so worth it in every way. The days I spent refining every single line, thinking about us as time passed, were some of the best moments I’ve had. I hope you love reading it as much as I loved writing it for you.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>From the very first moment I saw you, it was as if time stopped, and my heart skipped a beat. Your beauty struck me like lightning, an instant, overwhelming rush of emotions I’ve never felt before, and even now, every time I look at you, it feels like I’m discovering something new to fall in love with. You are, without a doubt, the most breathtaking woman on this planet, and just the thought of you makes my pulse race. It’s not just your beauty that gets to me, though it’s enough to make me weak—it’s the way your presence lit up my life and the way everything else fades into the background when you’re there.</p>

                    <p>Your eyes, my love, are my favorite. They’re so big, so deep, I feel like I could lose myself in them and still not find my way back, and honestly, I wouldn’t want to. They hold the universe, infinite and magical, and I could spend forever gazing into them. You’ve no idea how often I find myself just watching you, captivated by those eyes that say so much without speaking a word. And your cheeks, those cute, irresistible plump cheeks—I swear, they’re just begging to be kissed, to be adored. They’re like these perfect little treasures, so soft and full of life, that I just want to hold them and kiss them forever.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Then there’s your nose, the sweetest little part of you, always making me smile because it’s just so you. I want to kiss it every chance I get because you deserve all the tender love in the world. And don’t get me started on your lips—God, they drive me insane. Just looking at them for a few seconds sends my imagination into overdrive, and I can’t help but think of every kiss, every moment where I’m lost in their softness. They’re the kind of lips that you dream about, and I dream of them every time I see you.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>But it’s not just your face, though it’s the most perfect thing I’ve ever laid eyes on, it's also how incredibly emotionally mature you are. I’ve never met anyone, let alone a woman, who carries this kind of emotional depth and understanding. It’s honestly one of my favorite things about you. The way you handle every situation with such grace, always thinking deeply and responding thoughtfully, makes me love and respect you even more. It’s rare to find someone who truly gets emotions the way you do, and I feel so lucky that I get to experience that side of you every day. It’s also the way you smile, the way you laugh, the way you make everything feel better just by being there. I’ve fallen in love with you, completely and utterly, in ways I can’t even fully explain, and I’m grateful every day that you are mine. Every inch of you, inside and out, is nothing short of perfection, and I’m madly, hopelessly in love with it all.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Even though we’ve never met in person (changed now obviously), I feel like I’ve known you forever. Every picture I’ve seen of you, every word we’ve shared, has only deepened this feeling inside me. I know I don’t say it nearly enough, but you have the most heavenly, perfect body I’ve ever laid eyes on. There’s this allure to you, this natural, effortless beauty that makes you completely irresistible to me. I find myself staring at your photos, just taken by the way everything about you is so flawlessly put together. You’re stunning in ways I struggle to put into words, and it’s not just about how you look—it’s the energy, the charm, the way you carry yourself that has me hooked.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>But what really gets me is how deeply you love me, and the way you show it in everything you do. The way you think about us, the effort you put into every little detail, it all means the world to me. I know you sometimes struggle to express what’s in your heart with words, but that’s the thing—what we have goes beyond words. The way you make me feel can’t be explained, it can only be experienced. I feel your love in every message, in every conversation, and it’s something so powerful, so genuine, that I know it’s real.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>You understand me in ways no one else ever has. The way you get me, the way you’re there for me without me even having to say a word—it’s like we share the same heart. You’re protective, you’re possessive, and I love every bit of that, because it’s just like me. It’s like I’m looking in a mirror when I see how much you care, how fiercely you love, and how deeply you feel. We’re so similar, it’s more than just a dream come true. It’s like I’ve found the other half of me, someone I know I’ll never be incompatible with.</p>

                    <p>You’re my person. The one I’d want by my side forever. I never knew it was possible to feel this close, this connected, to someone I haven’t even met face-to-face yet, but here we are. You’re not just what I’ve always dreamed of, you’re so much more. You’re everything, and I don’t ever want to let that go.</p>

                    <p>I know you’ve had a past with someone, and I’ve thought about it a lot. To be completely honest, Navya, I’ll never see that as something emotionally real, even though I know you believe you loved him. I just can’t shake the feeling that you haven’t yet experienced the full, overwhelming warmth of true love—the kind that consumes you, lifts you up, and makes you feel alive in ways you didn’t know were possible. I believe, deep down, that what you felt before wasn’t that. It wasn’t this. I know it’s a part of me that loves exclusivity, that craves being your first in every way, but I’ve held onto this belief for a long time. I want to be the one who gives you that kind of love, the one who shows you what true love really feels like. I want to be your first actual love, the love that changes everything. And trust me, when you feel it, when you feel what I know we have, you’ll understand exactly what I mean.</p>

                    <p>Every hug will feel different, every kiss will feel different, and we’ll crave each other in ways you’ve never imagined. There’ll be this emotional craving, a passion that consumes us both, and a promise in every touch, every glance. It’s not just physical; it’s deeper, like our souls are constantly seeking each other, unable to rest unless we’re together. There’s this elegance to love, something beyond words, because when it’s real, it feels like coming home. And yet, at the same time, you become the home I crave—you are the place where I feel complete, and I find myself needing you in every single moment, in every possible way.</p>

                    <p>I know this because I’ve felt a part of it before, but with you, it’s different. With you, it’s like a more refined, more profound version of what love is supposed to be. It’s better—so much better than anything I’ve ever experienced. And the way it flows between us, the way we connect without even trying, it’s everything I’ve ever dreamed of and more. I love every bit of it, every moment with you, and I know that with you, this love is something I’ll never stop craving, something I’ll hold onto forever.</p>

                    <p>Navya, I know it might seem early to say all of this, but the way we’ve felt this connection, this bond between us, makes me realize that there’s no such thing as too early when it feels this right. Every moment we’ve shared, every word, every thought—I can’t hold back anymore. I’ve thought about it long enough, and I just can’t wait to ask you this. So here it is, my first official proposal to you, straight from my heart.</p>

I want us to face life together, hand in hand, through every joy, every challenge, and every moment that comes our way.</p>
